 For challenge one we took a source code from one of our in class exercises that
 printed out/let us cycle through a menu that had four different sub-menus.

 a program to allow the user to orderr as many items from the menu as they would
 like, utilizing different types of programming like. . .
 
 - For Loops
 - If-Else statements
 - While Loops
